/**
 * #2578, the page's side: what an agent does by its own hand (office_set) in a stored office (mounted: web-office-overview-2554).
 * - actsOk: the host's acts checked (GET /ui/office-acts, the `office_acts` event) — the well-formed ones, nothing else;
 *   each end moved onto the page's clock by the host's `now`.
 * - actLive: an act holds until its end, unless its person is called (a call wins) or asleep; with the page's `seen`
 *   memory, new work begun after it (working again after being seen otherwise, or after acting while idle) ends it.
 * - actTarget: an act's point; or beside the person it goes to, where they are now (else their seat); else none.
